Description: Framework for evaluating user-specified finite stage policies and learning realistic policies via doubly robust loss functions. Policy learning methods include doubly robust restricted Q-learning, sequential policy tree learning and outcome weighted learning. See Nordland and Holst (2022) <arXiv:2212.02335> for documentation and references.
